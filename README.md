# Intel(R) VTune(TM) Amplifier Perf tool

The Intel(R) VTune(TM) Amplifier Perf tool is the utility employed by [Intel(R) VTune(TM) Amplifier](https://software.intel.com/en-us/vtune) for performance data collection on Linux* based operating systems. See the Intel(R) VTune(TM) Amplifier documentation for more [information](https://software.intel.com/en-us/vtune-amplifier-help-driverless-event-based-sampling-collection) regarding Linux* Perf based analysis capabilities and configuration.

## Technical support

You may report your Intel(R) VTune(TM) Amplfier related technical issues and get some level of support at the official [VTune forum](https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-vtune-amplifier).

## Software license

Perf tool is a part of Linux* kernel which is distributed under GNU General Public License, v.2. You can find full text of the license in the files at the root of repository branches.

## Repository structure

The master branch contains this README.md file. The release branches are named like `amplxe_<major>_u<update>` (e.g., `amplxe_2019_u3`) and provide the utility source code with build instructions that are specific to the corresponding Intel(R) VTune(TM) Amplfier releases.

## Contribution

Check if the latest [stable or mainline](https://www.kernel.org/) Linux* Perf tool has the functionality you need. If the functionality is missing from there try mailing your request to Linux* Perf users [mailing list](mailto:linux-perf-users@vger.kernel.org). If you still didn't get the required level of support consider delivering the source code patches for mainline Linux* Perf tool to `linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org` mailing list.
